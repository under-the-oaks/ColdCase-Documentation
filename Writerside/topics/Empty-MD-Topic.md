# Colors

Colors play a defining role in giving "Cold Case" its unique appeal and act as a defining gameplay resource to give the player information about object properties.

## Contrast

The main purpose of the color palettes used in the creation of the sprites for both in-game worlds is to be as complementary as possible to each other.

This should underline the concept of the two players existing in two completely different spaces that aren't connected on first sight.
Only the transcendent elements disrupt the monochrome feel of each dimension therefore drawing attention to the interaction being possible between both worlds.

## Color-Coding

For example the transcendent movable block is visualized by the same sprite as the movable block but the glowing green color of the transcendent one shows the player that it is transcendent, therefore moves in the other players world too.
