# Level Design Plan

## Overview
This document defines the design principles, structure, and expected behavior of the tutorial levels in *ColdCase*. It outlines how players will be introduced to core mechanics and how the levels will gradually increase in complexity to foster cooperative gameplay.

---

## Design Goals
1. **Progressive Learning Curve:** Each level should introduce a new mechanic, reinforcing previously learned concepts.
2. **Encouraging Cooperation:** Players must learn to communicate and work together to solve puzzles.
3. **Ensuring Clarity:** Clear visual cues and intuitive interactions to minimize confusion.

## Level Structure

### **Level 1 – The First Step**
- **Objective:** Teach players how local blocks work.
- **Mechanics Introduced:**
    - Players move **local blocks** that do not affect the parallel world.
    - Learn that **each world has separate physics**.
- **Expected Outcome:**
    - Players understand how their actions affect only their world.
    - They start experimenting with movement mechanics.

### **Level 2 – The Detective’s Glove**
- **Objective:** Introduce the glove and portal mechanics.
- **Mechanics Introduced:**
    - The **glove** allows interaction with objects.
    - The **portal** is used to transfer the glove between players.
- **Expected Outcome:**
    - Players recognize that passing the glove is necessary for solving puzzles.
    - They begin to coordinate actions to progress.

---

### **Level 3 – The Switch**
- **Objective:** Introduce the concept of switches and their effect on spikes.
- **Mechanics Introduced:**
    - The **switch** can be activated using the glove.
    - Activating a switch removes spikes **in the parallel world**.
- **Expected Outcome:**
    - Players understand that they need to collaborate to clear obstacles.
    - They develop a strategy for interacting with shared game elements.

## Conclusion
The level design ensures a **smooth learning curve**, reinforcing cooperative gameplay while introducing mechanics progressively. Through **gradual complexity increases and clear guidance**, players will be well-prepared for the full game experience.
