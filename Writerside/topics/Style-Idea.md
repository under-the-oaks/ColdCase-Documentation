# Style

This page documents the main decision-making and elements of the projects style.

## Isometric Perspective

The choice of perspective is related to the tile-based movement system and the decision to make the sprites look 3D.

If the game was top-down it would have made the creation of good-looking and distinguishable sprites very hard and making it isometric fixes a lot of problems occlusion could generate.
Another benefit and argument for choosing isometric perspective comes from the visual dynamic it brings by disrupting the symmetry of the otherwise block-style visuals.

It generally elevates the visual appeal.

## Character Design

Almost from start the team knew the game would include two main characters:
- The Detective![Detective12.png](Detective12.png)

- The Ghost![Sprite_Ghost_Down.png](Sprite_Ghost_Down.png)


So a lot of early attention was put on designing and creating those two characters that should form the backbone of the game and design.

They were each sketched in a couple of ways and then the team voted on which design should see production and make it into the game, as well as define the style of the game by setting the first stone.

## Low-Poly

The design of "Cold Case" could fit the definition of being "Low-Poly", in other words: Models have a low count of polygons.
It is a style that requires less effort to generate visually appealing sprites and create a unique look and feel for the game.

Since the decision of creating sprites and not just getting them from a remote source, the team had to closely examine, what was possible in the given time-frame.

The result is a stylized low-poly look for the game, which features block elements and an abstract world, not resembling any particular real-life locations.
This enhances the focus on the communication and puzzle component of the game and removes any confusion concerning visuals, like unambiguity, for the players.

## Chess-Style

Movements in "Cold Case" happen from position A to B.
Like in the game chess, there is no in between and no explicit dynamic or visual movement happening.
So adapting the game to go down the visual path of chess seamed apparent.
The alternative would have been to implement animations and movements, so the team just decided to go for a chess-like aesthetic.

Therefore, the main characters stand on a pedestal, showing they are motionless, like a chess piece would be.

Another inspiration from chess each block or square has his own identifier, easing communication between the to players significantly.
